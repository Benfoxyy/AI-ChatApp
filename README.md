# Planning For Future
This bot is not compleated yet, And i've got multiple ideas to add it in future like :

- AI history
- Multiple AI models ( user can select through it )
- Plans system like <b>FREE, STANDARD, PRO, UNLIMITED</b>

# Setup 

### Deployment
If you wanna just see and work with the resualt, I've deployed my project with `Streamlit Cloud` and you can access to it with this url : https://benbot.streamlit.app

But if you need to use it in you project or deal with their structures,
you can follow these easy steps :

### Clone Project
For cloning this project in you computer you can just enter this `git` command in your `terminal` and open it :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Benfoxyy/AI-ChatApp.git
cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
```

### Virtual Environment
Now lets create a virtual environment ( venv ) for manage and our installing pakages :
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Active your `venv` for working with it :
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS and Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Requirements
I put every single pakages you need to install in `requeirements.txt` file, So you can just run this command in your `venv` :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Key
Set up OpenAI API Key: You will need to set up your OpenAI API key. You can get this key from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">OpenAI's platform</a> .

Once you have your key, create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project directory with the following content:
```toml
[openai]
api_key = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

### Run It!
As i said ; I've used `streamlit` for this project, in spite of this we're gonna run it on streamlit client :
```bash
streamlit run AI.py
``` 
By running this command you will see the resault in you browser ðŸŽ‰
